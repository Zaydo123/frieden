    let message = `Since we started in 2022, we have dedicated ourselves to fostering positive transformation within refugee camps worldwide. Our current efforts are concentrated on assisting those affected by the ongoing conflicts in the Levant region. Comprised of a global network of members and volunteers, we are engaged in executing impactful initiatives designed to enhance community well-being. Currently, we are in the process of establishing a strategic partnership with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency and UNICEF to accurately assess the needs of refugee camps in Jordan. This collaboration aims to facilitate the provision of essential humanitarian supplies, including medicine, toiletries, and other basic necessities, directly to the refugees residing in these camps. However, we are also committed to addressing homelessness within the United States and providing disaster relief as part of our broader objectives. We invite you to participate in our events and contribute towards effective, tangible change.`;
