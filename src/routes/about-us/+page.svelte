      <p class="text-lg mb-3">A distinctive aspect of our approach lies in our fundraising strategy through our diverse programs, setting us apart in our field. Rather than solely soliciting donations, we offer incentives to engage our supporters actively. Furthermore, we are committed to educating the public on the critical issues at hand. Our Instagram account serves as a vital platform for this purpose, where we share insightful content, stories from the field, and updates on our initiatives, thereby fostering a well-informed community of advocates and contributors. We believe that by engaging the public in fun and meaningful activities, we can inspire them to support our mission and make a positive impact in the world. Our events are designed to bring people together, foster a sense of community, and promote social change.</p>

        Frieden is a German word, it means peace. You might be wondering why Germany is significant when it comes to refugees. Indeed, Germany is one of the major host countries for refugees. According to Frontiers in Political Science, "Hosting over 1 million refugees in 2022, Germany is the fifth largest host country worldwide. Over half of these 1 million refugees in Germany, particularly 560,000 of them, are Syrians [from the UNHCR 2021 report]. Together with other non-citizens, this group of refugees makes up 13.1% of foreigners in Germany in 2020" <a class="text-red-500 underline" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpos.2023.1100446/full">(Frontiers in Political Science, 2023).</a>
